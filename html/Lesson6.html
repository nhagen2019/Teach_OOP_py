    <h1>This is a lesson that talks about some of the different functions included in the string class</h1>
    <p>In this set of lessons we have talked a lot about how to make and use different classes. We can do the same with classes and libraies that are already in existence.
    A good example of a class that already has a bunch of different functions is the string class.
    This class has a bunch of different function that can be called by any string that already exists This file includes some differnt basic examples of what can be done with
    these functions.</p>
    <p>The below website has a good list of what is possible to do with the string class:</p>
